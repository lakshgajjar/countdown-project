📌 Project Output Summary
1. Countdown Display

At the top, a clear box shows a live countdown to January 1, 2026.

The timer updates every second:

X Days Y Hours Z Minutes W Seconds

When time runs out, it transforms into:

“Time’s up! The event has started 🎉”

Two buttons orbit this ticking box:

Pause Countdown — freezes time for a moment.

Reset — snaps the countdown back to the original target date.

2. Quotes Section

Beneath the countdown sits a soft white panel where motivational quotes appear one at a time.
These lines quietly rotate every 4 seconds, like pages flipping in a calm breeze.

You can also control the flow manually using:

Previous

Next

The quotes are short and uplifting — courage, effort, destiny, beginnings.

3. Modal (Not Visible)

The code tries to work with a modal window, but none exists in the HTML — like a ghost door leading nowhere.
So nothing related to a modal actually appears.
